How do I make API requests?
-----------------------------

Similarly to previous APIs we have worked with, a request requires a URL. The Etsy API's base URL is `https://openapi.etsy.com/v2`

and is supplemented with other commands to include in the request. You can specify store or user name, for example. Other optional parameters need to be prepended with a question mark. Finally, you need to add your API key to every request URL.
