// Random Number
//
// Write an app that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 10
// The user types her answer in an input field
// Indicate if the user's guess is too high or too low
// If the user guesses the number, indicate that she's won
// Don't use alert
// Update the DOM to indicate win, too low, too high, and any other messages
// You'll probably want to use parseInt to convert the user's input from a string to an integer
// You'll probably want to use Math.random() to generate a random number for the user to guess
